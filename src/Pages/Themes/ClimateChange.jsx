              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Youth in a nation has the power to bring about big changes like social reforms, and economic growth and help to achieve global targets like striving for climate justice or practising sustainability. It is crystal clear by now that the development of the country needs active and meaningful participation from young people from all corners.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                For instance, the Indian Government currently invests 1,00,000 INR crores yearly in youth development through various targeted and non-targeted programmes. This has brought substantially great returns for the country when youth participation in government campaigns has increased to 67% in 2022. International forums like the G20 have identified and accepted the youth's role and responsibilities towards bringing global change. Similarly, the platform has created a youth-centric engagement group called Youth20 or Y20.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                The Y20 group allows young leaders across the globe to discuss and negotiate worldly matters and suggest valuable suggestions for the G20 leaders to take forward. Under India's G20 presidency for 2023, the Y20 summit will be hosted by India and the key focus will be on global youth leadership and partnership.

              One of the themes for the Y20 India summit is "Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction: Making Sustainability a Way of Life." Take a look at the forthwith section to understand the significance of these two pressing themes in the youth context and how they can inspire actions towards building a more resilient and sustainable future for all.

                As the world population rapidly grows in number, the intensity of the earth's finite resources decreases in number. The hour of embracing sustainability at all levels to provide a safe and secure environment for future generations is here.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                In this context, the United Nations has initiated a 2023 Agenda, a plan of action for the planet, people and prosperity. This agenda recognises 17 sustainable development goals and 169 targets to march ahead and shift the world onto a sustainably resilient path.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Moreover, this 2030 Agenda applies to the world's 1.2 billion young people who consist of 16% of the global population to work together in harmony and universal brotherhood. The effective management of collaborating with youth to achieve sustainability goals could assist in preventing and reducing threats due to climate change, gender inequality, hunger and poverty. This would in turn lead to a more inclusive, stable and developed economy around the globe.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                On 16 June 2022, the Council of the European Union (EU) adopted a Recommendation on learning for the green transition and sustainable development. This recommendation is a key policy statement highlighting the crucial role of education and training in working towards the goals of achieving sustainable development.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This year in G20, India has proposed a worldwide mission called, 'LiFe (Lifestyle for Environment) initiative. It is a call to action for every citizen to practice sustainability and mindful utilisation of resources over 'mindless destructive consumption.'
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                The 'LiFe' initiative makes the fight against climate change historically democratic where every citizen plays a key role. It aims to inspire the citizens and communities to lead a lifestyle that is in close synchrony with nature's limited resources and help minimise any exhaustion of those resources. A model of production and consumption that entails industries and markets adopting the concept of 'reduce, reuse, recycle.'
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                As India comprises more than 65% of the youth majority, they can actively contribute to the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFe) initiative. Additionally, 'LiFe' seeks to implement such foundation techniques into the regular habit to have a more powerful impact.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                According to recent data, an average carbon footprint of a person in India is 0.56 tonnes per year, compared to the global average of 4 tonnes. India's traditional knowledge, social norms and daily household practices strongly position it to take on individual action to tackle the climate change issue through this mass movement in the form of 'LiFe Mission.'

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Events like the 21-day challenge to mitigate needless resource wastage initiated by the government were lauded by youth and received good participation throughout the nation. Some of the other notable achievements of Indian initiatives in environmental conservation include:

                Mitigating Disaster Risks
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Mitigation from any natural calamity or man-made disaster is very important while thinking about global sustainability options. Disaster mitigation is a group effort to lessen the impact of disasters on people and property. It means working on disaster-resilient infrastructure, enforcing effective aids to tackle calamity-prone situations, etc.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                According to the Global Assessment Report on disaster risk reduction (GAR2022), if current trends continue, the number of disasters per year globally may increase from around 400 in 2015 to 560 per year by 2030 – a projected increase of 40% during the lifetime of the Sendai Framework. Also it estimates that the number of extreme temperature events per year is also increasing, and based on current trends will almost triple between 2001 and 2030. Disasters have negative impacts on biodiversity and environmental sustainability. These trends and numbers miss to calculate the ongoing climate change influences that are accelerating which is leading to unpredictable disaster forecasts.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                It goes without saying that the global stability is at risk along with recognisable challenges to economy and environment. Conventional approaches to mitigate the disasters by far have had lesser impacts, so systematic risk governance needs to develop causal structures, dynamic responses to tackle the global systemic risk.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                If climate change is a shared global challenge, then it is also a massive energy challenge. Energy accounts for over two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions. This means energy must be at the heart of any solution to tackle rising temperatures.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                To achieve the goals of sustainable development, energy emissions must decline and this requires a dramatic acceleration in the transitions towards clean, renewable and sustainable energy.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                For instance, renewable technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and hydropower in recent years are indicative that clean energy solutions are possible and would decrease energy emission rates exponentially if deployed right.

Renewables are set to account for almost 95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026, with solar PV alone providing more than half. The amount of renewable capacity added over the period of 2021 to 2026 is expected to be 50% higher than from 2015 to 2020.
